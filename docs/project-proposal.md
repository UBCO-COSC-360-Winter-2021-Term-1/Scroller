## Project Description and Details

Scroller is a website that will function as a Reddit-like clone, but much better. Scroller will allow registered users to participate in online discussion forums. Registered users can create discussion posts containing images, texts, and links and reply to any post or comment. Scroller will be supported on multiple web browsers and including on mobile devices. Using an asynchronous approach, Scroller will update in real-time. Overall, Scroller will be the version Reddit is meant to be, made from developers who care, and Scroller will create a community full of support.

## Requirements List

- Ensure that when a user logs on to the site, the menus will reflect the proper changes.
- Incorporate a responsive design (i.e., nav links will highlight when hovered).
- Add client and server-side form validation to ensure there is appropriate security for the data.
- Have the server-side script coded with PHP.
- Use MySQL as the Data storage.
- The site will maintain state (ex., user state being logged on).
- Enable cross-browser support (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) and phone operating systems.
- Have a responsive layout for mobile.
- Add AJAX support
- Allow users to add profile pictures and images while having them stored in the database.
- Group discussion threads and replies.
- Usage of breadcrumb strategy.
- Have a measure of error handling for bad navigation.
- Add an upvote system to the threads. Anytime a user likes a post, they can upvote it and move it up the rankings (Hot threads). If they dislike it, then then the post moves down the rankings.
- Create a registration page.
- Add password recovery functionality.
- Search for specific posts.
- Have different categories for the topics.
- Create a settings page to allow the user to change their name and password.
- Allow admins to delete/hide posts and comments.
- Use icons from <https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons>.
